**Description:** We finish introducing the basic notions of functional analysis including subspaces, quotient spaces, and seminorms (almost norms). Then we prove some necessary fundamental theorems for moving forward: the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem. The former theorem is the only category theory known to the instructor.Â
