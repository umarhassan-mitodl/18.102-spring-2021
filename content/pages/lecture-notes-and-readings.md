There is no assigned textbook for this course. Instead, we will follow lecture notes written by Professor Richard Melrose when he taught the course in 2020, as well as lecture notes taken by MIT student Andrew Lin who took the class with Dr. Rodriguez in 2021. (Both sets of notes used with permission.)
